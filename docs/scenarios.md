# Scenario no. 1
Al≈æbeta has been working hard on solving the current competition problems.
She has solved the problems on a piece of paper and she only has her phone at hand.
It's the last day of the competition and the final countdown is approaching.
She wants to submit her solutions without any unforeseen obstacles.
To do this she needs to log in to the website with her Trojsten ID.
Then, she needs to navigate to the current competition's problems.
Following that, she must take a picture of her handwritten solutions and upload each one to the corresponding problem.

## Before:
	+ She would have to upload a PDF of her solutions. But she found it difficult to create PDF files from her photos.
	+ She would need to read the rules in order to find out what problems she can solve with the category she's competing in.

## After:
	+ She can upload images of her solutions.
	+ She get shown only the problem she can solve with the category she's competing in.
## Before

Now that she knows what problems to focus on, she can solve them. After solving the problems has to convert photos of her solutions into PDFs and upload them to corresponding problems.

## After
